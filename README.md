# Foodle

Our vision behind this app is a mock up version of flickr for food. 
Adding to the recipe book idea, each user will be able to post pictures 
of thier own recipes along with the rating they would give it.
Other users will be allowed to comment on said posts and rate them 
after trying the recipe and can give it their own rating giving peoples 
recipes a sense of credibility to the recipes people post.
